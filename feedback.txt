Please find enclosed your project listing annotated with comments
about coding style.

In summary, you received 70 / 70 possible points for correctness
and quality of guesses (the objecteive assessment), and  23 / 30
marks for code quality.  Your submission was 0 hours late,
with an extension of 0 hours, incurring a penalty of 0%.
This all gives you

    93.000000% 

for this project.  This will be scaled to the value of the project.

We assessed your code quality according to these criteria, leading to
your  23 / 30 marks for code quality:

  4 / 5  Quality of file-level documentation, including authorship

  4 / 5  Quality of predicate-level documentation

  5 / 5  Readability of code (lines not wrapped, good, consistent
         layout)

  3 / 5  Understandability of code (good choice of names,
         no redundant comments, well organised)

  4 / 5  Appropriate abstraction (no chunks of repeated code; no
         really long clauses, good types

  3 / 5  Good use of logic programming paradigm

These assessments reflect the annotations in the accompanying program
listing.

Each of these criteria was assessed on this 0-5 scale:

    5 = practically flawless
    4 = very good, but not perfect
    3 = passable, but not great
    2 = unsatisfactory, but on the right track
    1 = very poor
    0 = no effort
