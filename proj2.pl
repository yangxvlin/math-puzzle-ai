%  Purpose  : Prolog program to solve the math puzzle
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%|This code is for providing the implementation for the math puzzle solver.
%% It is defined in one main predicate: 
%%     puzzle_solution(+Puzzle)
%%     puzzle_solution/1.
%%
%% The program is for solving the math puzzle with a n*n squares of grids and a
%% number for each row and column (a graphical representation is given below).
%% With constraints:
%%      1. the left-top to bottom right diagonal requires same digit
%%      2. each column sums or products to the given row number
%%      3. each row sums or products to the given row number
%%      4. each row's digits are different
%%      5. each column's digits are different
%%      6. each cell of the puzzle matrix is 1-9 digit
%% 
%% The program approachs the solution by:
%%      1. unifies diagonal to the same digit
%%      2. generate each row that satisfies constraint 3) 4)
%%      3. then do the same thing to each column by transpose the puzzle 
%%         so that can reuse the predicates for rows to unifies columns 
%%      4. ensure each cell in the n*n puzzle is ground.
%%
%% The program assumes:
%%      1. The input puzzle matrix is 2*2, 3*3 or 4*4 size (i.e.: n range from
%%         2-4 inclusively).
%%      2. The input Puzzle data structure is made up of an ignored top left
%%         corner, bounded header numbers, puzzle matrix with partially bounded
%%         or unbounded cells. Detailed example is given below.
%%      3. The puzzle has at least one solution or returns false if not
%%         solvable when a proper Puzzle is given.

%			Major predicate
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% puzzle_solution(+Puzzle).
%% It takes a Puzzle and unifies it so that the Puzzle satisfies the 
%% constraints listed above. The predicate holds when the Puzzle is the
%% representation of a solved maths puzzle. Otherwise the result is false.
%%
%% e.g.: 
%% ?- Puzzle=[[0,14,10,35],[14,_,_,_],[15,_,_,_],[28,_,1,_]],
%% |    puzzle_solution(Puzzle).
%% Puzzle = [[0, 14, 10, 35], [14, 7, 2, 1], [15, 3, 7, 5], [28, 4, 1, 7]] ;
%% false.
%%
%% Note: 1) Some cells of the puzzle can be given a digit in the input. 
%%       Otherwise input has "_" for the predicate to find a digit for unbound
%%       cell.
%%       2) The first list of Puzzle is the column number for each math puzzle 
%%       column ("0" has no meaning just for distinguishing a cell place).
%%       The rest lists' first elemens are the row number for each row. The 
%%       rest is the matrix to be found digits for.
%%       3) In the above example, [14,10,35] in first list is the column
%%       numbers. [14,15,18] is the first element of the rest lists is the row
%%       numbers. A digit 1 is given in row 3 column 2. 
%%       Represent it graphically:
%%       +---+---+---+---+                   +---+---+---+---+
%%       |  0| 14| 10| 35|                   |  0| 14| 10| 35|
%%       +---+---+---+---+                   +---+---+---+---+
%%       | 14|  _|  _|  _|                   | 14|  7|  2|  1|
%%       +---+-----------+  == solved to =>  +---+-----------+
%%       | 15|  _|  _|  _|                   | 15|  3|  7|  5|
%%       +---+-----------+                   +---+-----------+
%%       | 18|  _|  1|  _|                   | 18|  4|  1|  7|
